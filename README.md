# React Practice

React Practice Exercises from reactpractice.dev

I also rewrote most of the exercises in NextJS with TypeScript instead of the default plain react from the exercises

### Approach
1. Do all the react stuff without styling
2. Go back and style everything with Tailwind (and try to make it look pretty)
