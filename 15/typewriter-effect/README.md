# Build a Typewriter effect component

> This repository is the companion to the ["Build a Typewriter effect component"](TODO ADD LINK) practice exercise.

Given a sentence, display it with half a second delay between each character.
Start showing nothing and then display characters one by one until the full sentence is displayed.
No style is required.

To get started, you can clone this starter repo.
When you're ready to check your work, check out [the official solution](TODO ADD LINK).

## Getting started:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

Add your code to the `src/TypewriterEffect.jsx` file.
